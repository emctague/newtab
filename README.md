# Tague's New Tab Page

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tagues-new-tab-page/gpikjebkoliccjgjndkdklcngadcpplp

I built this because, as of late, I have been getting better performance out of Chrome than
Firefox on my computer, but don't like that it shows your recent page history on the New Tab
Page. Other custom New Tab Page extensions seem suspiciously large or have a strange impact on
performance, sometimes requesting permissions that an extension of that sort shouldn't need.
Hence, I made my own.

It's smaller and faster than the others I have tried.
